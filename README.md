# About
Official implementation of the paper *From Herd-Level to Individualized Control: A Hybrid State-Space Model for Feeding Individual Dairy Cows*.

This model is designed to predict individual cow responses—such as milk yield, methane emissions, and body weight changes—to varying feed intake levels.

## Installation
This model is tested on Matlab R2022b
